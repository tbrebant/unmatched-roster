# Guide to add a new fighter to *[Unmatched Roster](https://tbrebant.github.io/unmatched-roster/)*

This guide is intended for people with little or no experience using GitHub or working with code *(if you are, feel free to make a PR!)*.

To get a new (official) fighter added, simply gather the information listed below and send it to me either:
- As a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tbrebant/unmatched-roster/issues) *(preferred, I'm more likely to see it quickly)*.
- Or in this [boardgamegeek's thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3052143/unmatched-roster-a-list-of-all-existing-fighters-w).


| Information | Description / Example |
|---|---|
| **Fighter name** | *Muhammad Ali* |
| **Short description of their playstyle** | Not just the skill but how the fighter plays, his specifics, to help users immediately determine whether it's a character they would enjoy playing without having to go through all the cards. Example: *Ali is a melee fighter able to switch between two different stances, one giving him some attack distance and the other stronger punches. He's often able to read opponent's mind by looking at his cards.* |
| **Ability's description** | *Ali has two stances: one allows him to attack 2 spaces away and empowers some of his cards, the other one gives him +2 to all of his attacks.* |
| **Name of the Unmatched set** | *Lee vs Ali* |
| **BoardGameGeek link to the set** | *`https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/428308/unmatched-lee-vs-ali`* |
| **Deck URL** | Either from the [Unmatched Database (UmDb)](https://unmatched.cards/umdb/decks/) or the [Unmatched Club](https://www.the-unmatched.club/heroes)<br>*`https://www.the-unmatched.club/heroes/muhammad-ali`* |
| **Lore or background information URL** | *`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali`* |
| **Card background image URL** | Must be good quality (at least 300px wide). |
| **Miniature image(s) URL(s)** | Provide one URL per miniature (usually one, sometimes multiple) or a page with all of them.<br>Images should be good quality (ideally between 600 and 800px high). |
| **Set release date** | *November 2025* |
| **Optional: Video strategy guide url(s)** | From any content creator you like. The deeper the analysis, the better, in order for players to prepare their fights beforehand. Examples: *`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CgEKhM_Hlc`, `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouQlosnRceI`*|.
| **Optional: Your name / pseudonym / URL** | If you want to appear on the website as a contributor. |

That's all! As soon as I receive the information, I'll add the new entries to the roster.
